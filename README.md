## A complete CI/CD project
This project is a part of the Udacity Cloud DevOps nanodegree and executes the following:

- Sets up a complete blue deployment with infrastructure including:
  - Static website deployed in an S3 bucket
  - Cloudfront pointing to the static website
- Creates a green deployment with the following infrastructure:
  - S3 website frontend
  - EC2 backend with NodeJS
  - Postgres Database
- Integration tests with:
  - Slack integration
  - Frontend and backend smoke testing
- Sets up centralised structured logging and diagnosis with:
  - Prometheus for monitoring
  - Gmail for automated notifications

Blue-green deployment happens after all tests are complete
